# SBA308
This was a very challenging test for me. I know that if I look back at this one day, it may seem simple. I am realizing that the hard part about coding is not the syntax but it is developing a specific type of logic to think about what is needed and how to tell the computer to do that. Throughout this process, I have improved thinking in microsteps because that is what the computer relies on. computers are not human and they aren't psychic so they have to be told everything . Like literally everything... 

Well, I am a beginner with 5 months of experience, so unfortunately at this time this is the best i can do. I'm still proud of myself. I know I will get better with more time.
(pass me please!)
